### What I learned

I've been coding for some years so CSS isn't something new for me, but this is my first time trying to use BEM methodology. As this is something new for me, i do not spect to do it perfect, but i will keep learned and improving my skills. 
This is the first step building a portafolio, so i do appreciate the feedback and all your good comments ;)

## Form validation

In the subscription form section, the code compares the email input value against a regular expression trought the test() function. it's return true or false, and depends of result, it's show or hide the error message and apply the error styles.

I made this part with vanilla Javascript, using the module pattern estructure. 

```js
(() => {
    const App = {
        htmlElements: {
            form: document.getElementById('form'),
            input: document.getElementById('input-email'),
            error: document.getElementById('error-message')
        },
        init: () => {
            App.bindEvents();
        },
        bindEvents: () => {
            App.htmlElements.form.addEventListener('submit', App.events.subscribe)
        },
        events: {
            subscribe: (event) => {
                event.preventDefault();
                App.utils.validateForm(App.htmlElements.input.value);
            }
        },
        utils: {
            validateForm: (value) => {
                const regex = /[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,3}$/
                const validate = regex.test(value);
                if (!validate) {
                    App.htmlElements.error.style.display = 'block';
                    App.htmlElements.input.classList.add('footer__newsletter__input--error');
                } else {
                    App.htmlElements.error.style.display = 'none';
                    App.htmlElements.input.classList.remove('footer__newsletter__input--error');
                }
            }
        },
    }
    App.init();
})();
```
### Continued development

I will definitely continue learning about CSS and practicing the BEM methodology. I also want to complete more frontend-mentor challenges and learn about SASS and SCSS, why not?
